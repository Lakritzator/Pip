Pip
===

This is just an example of something which was requested in this tweet: https://twitter.com/LyalinDotCom/status/1163934205971091456?s=20

A picture in picture tool, currently just a prototype.

How does it work?

* When the window you want to mirror as a small thumbnail is active, press the hotkey (Ctrl + Shift + P is the default)
* A small thumbnail window appears, you can move it around with the left mouse button or close it by right-click
* You can also close it by using the hotkey again on the same window as you used before
* There is a configuration, when you can change the opaqueness and also if only the client area of the window is mirrored.

Currently it supports 5 thumbnails simultanious, the default locations are fixed on the right side of the screen.

You can change the hotkey in the pip.ini located at %APPDATA%\Pip when it's not running.
